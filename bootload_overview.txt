[1]the BIOS loads the bootloader (GRUB) from the virtual hard drive (the ISO)

[2]the bootloader reads the kernel executable and finds the Multiboot header

[3]it copies the .boot and .text sections to memory (to addresses 0x100000 and 0x100020)

[4]it jumps to the entry point (0x100020, you can obtain it through objdump -f)

[5]our kernel prints the green OK and stops the CPU
